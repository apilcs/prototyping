The "Asian-Pacific Island and Littoral Studies" (APILS) is an open-access online journal, which aims to promote knowledge on the islands and litorals of the Asia-Pacific regions in all areas that relate to the Humanities and Social Sciences. Papers submitted can fall into the academic fields of Anthropology, Sociology, Linguistics, Literature, History, and Human Geography, provided that they have a direct relations with the islands or littorals of the Asia-Pacific Region.

亞太島嶼與沿海文化研究期刊 (APILCS)，是為促進亞太沿岸各島間的知識以及相關人文社科研究而發行的線上開放瀏覽期刊。刊行的論文可歸入人類學、社會學、語言學、文學、歷史與人文地理學的學術領域，只需所發表內容與亞太島嶼或沿岸有直接相關。

More than being a journal that can be accessed online, this journal tries to advance the way that scientific and socially relevant information is communicated by exploring new techniques in the dynamic design of web-pages, which include digital maps, timelines, interactive graphs, cross-references among papers and data deposits. Helping readers and authors to synthesize the collected material, ideas and insights, the journal should not be the end-point of a scientific endeavors, but an incubation center where new ideas can directly be build on previously shared insights and data.

本期刊不僅開放線上瀏覽，並試圖透過動態網頁設計的新技術：包含數位地圖、時間軸、交互式圖表與相互連結參考的方式來提升論文與數據儲存間的社科相關資訊。

We thus require that digital data used to build graphs or models are shared with the paper.
These data deposits are uploaded with the paper and should at least all data that have been used in the development of the paper. They are available for reviewers and general readership, and must be provided under an open access license, such as Creative Commons. Data deposits will receive a DOI, can be cited, and must include metadata. Simple text-based data formats are prefered. Comma-separated-value (CSV) files or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files are good examples for generally accessible formats for text-based data files.

數據存交意指與該論文一同上傳的數據集與元數據。該數據內容可供審稿人與一般讀者獲取，並且在開放原始碼（例如創用CC）下提供。數據存交將獲得DOI，使該論文能被引用。

After the review process, editors and authors will closely collaborate to prepare the digital edition. This includes the extraction of relevant spatial and temporal information and to represent this in interactive maps, timelines and other kinds of graphs. These maps and graphs can be accessed from within the article and read in parallel to the text of the article in a way that the synthetic view of text and maps and graphs can help to create new meanings or to easily convey the intended meaning.

在論文審查後，編輯與作者們將為數位線上期刊密切合作。包含提取空間與時間的相關訊息，以及將交互式地圖、時間軸與相關圖表進行再現。讀者將能在同一視窗中同時讀取論文的文字、地圖與圖表，由此可幫助創造研究之新發現或更容易找發掘潛在的新研究問題。

Maps, timelines and interactive graphs serve as entry points to articles and sections in articles. Information from all articles is synthesized into maps and timelines, so that clicking on 'Okinawa', takes the reader to all relevant articles. With maps, timelines and other interactive graphs compiled for each paper, volume, and the entire journal archive, we map the region in academic papers. In the long run all papers regarding one island or archipelago are linked from the same map, even if they were published at different times or in different languages.

上述的地圖、時間軸或交互式圖表皆可成為進入論文或進一步獲取該內文章節的進入點。所有論文中的資訊將被綜合呈現於地圖或時間軸中。例如讀者若點選地圖中的「沖繩」，介面將會帶領讀者揭示期刊中所有與之相關的論文內容。透過整合各篇論文中的地圖、時間軸以及交互式圖表，本期刊將標示出所有該區域相關之學術論文。在未來，同一座島嶼或群島相關的論文將被鍵結在同一張地圖上，即使各篇論文使用不同語言或在不同時間出版。

The journal will accept papers for review on a rolling basis and publish them online once they have passed the review and editing processes. Papers thematically connected, e.g. discussing various aspects of the Okinawa archipelago, will be interlinked online through maps, timelines and cross-references. As soon as a certain number of papers on a certain island, archipelago, a period or a research method have been published, papers will be bundled in a paper edition of the journal on that topic, allowing editors to rework their papers in the light of new insights created through correlated papers.

本期刊將進行論文審查，並於審查通過與編輯程序後在線上公開發布。各篇論文將以主題進行交互連結，例如：沖繩島嶼相關的引用將透過地圖、時間軸與交互連結參照的方式呈現。一旦某個島嶼、群島、某個歷史時期或同一種研究方法在論文發表上累積了一定的數量，將從線上論文出版實體紙本期刊，以使研究成果的流通性更為廣泛。

Submissions should be generally limited to 20 pages, without counting figures, tables and images. However reviewers might require to develop some aspects of the paper, e.g. definitions on debated concepts, a detailed description of research methods, data collections, data annotation, data processing, data analysis and last but not least the interpretation of the findings, all to meet up with the high standards of the journal.

Submissions in ODT, DOCX and PDF are welcomed under apilcsjournal@gmail.com
