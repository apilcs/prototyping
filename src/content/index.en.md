title: Asia-Pacific Island and Littoral Studies
---

_Asian-Pacific Island and Littoral Studies_ (APILS) is a peer-reviewed, online, open-access journal, which aims to promote knowledge on the islands and litorals of the Asia-Pacific regions in all areas that relate to the Humanities and Social Sciences. Papers submitted can fall into the academic fields of Anthropology, Sociology, Linguistics, Literature, History, and Human Geography, provided that they have a direct relations with the islands or littorals of the Asia-Pacific Region.

Besides publishing cutting edge research on islands in the Asia-Pacific, we strive to advance the way that scientific information is communicated by exploring new techniques in the dynamic design of web-pages, which include digital maps, timelines, interactive graphs, cross-references among papers and data deposits. Helping readers and authors to synthesize the collected material, ideas and insights, APILS is not the end-point of scientific effort, but an incubator where new ideas can directly be build on previously shared insights and data.

We require that submissions, wherever possible, include the data used to build graphs or models. Data deposits are uploaded in conjunction with the paper and should include all data that was used in the development of the paper. They will be available for reviewers and end-users, and must be provided under an open access license, such as Creative Commons.

After the review process, editors and authors will closely collaborate to prepare the digital edition. This includes the extraction of relevant spatial and temporal information and to represent this in interactive maps, timelines and other kinds of graphs. These maps and graphs can be accessed from within the article and read in parallel to the text of the article in a way that the synthetic view of text and maps and graphs can help to create new meanings or to easily convey the intended meaning.

Maps, timelines and interactive graphs serve as entry points to articles and sections in articles. Information from all articles is synthesized into maps and timelines, so that clicking on 'Okinawa', takes the reader to all relevant articles. With maps, timelines and other interactive graphs compiled for each paper, volume, and the entire journal archive, we map the region in academic papers. In the long run all papers regarding one island or archipelago are linked from the same map, even if they were published at different times or in different languages.

The journal will accept papers for review on a rolling basis and publish them online once they have passed the review and editing processes. Papers thematically connected, e.g. discussing various aspects of the Okinawa archipelago, will be interlinked online through maps, timelines and cross-references. As soon as a certain number of papers on a certain island, archipelago, a period or a research method have been published, papers will be bundled in a paper edition of the journal on that topic, allowing editors to rework their papers in the light of new insights created through correlated papers.

Submissions should be generally limited to 20 pages, without counting figures, tables and images. However reviewers might require to develop some aspects of the paper, e.g. definitions on debated concepts, a detailed description of research methods, data collections, data annotation, data processing, data analysis and last but not least the interpretation of the findings, all to meet up with the high standards of the journal.

Submissions in ODT, DOCX and PDF are welcomed under apilcsjournal@gmail.com
